Cluster 1:
In the provided code pairs, several common edit patterns can be observed across different problems, primarily focusing on variable assignments and condition checks. 

1. **Variable Assignments**: In the `noTeenSum` method, the variable `n` is repeatedly assigned to the input parameters (`a`, `b`, and `c`) but is consistently used without correctly processing the values. The final code reflects an incorrect assignment where the original values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are replaced by `n`, which is initialized to zero.

2. **Condition Changes**: In the `luckySum` method, a conditional check for the value `c` was altered from checking for the value `0` to checking for the value `13`. This reflects a shift in the logic for handling specific values, indicating a focus on accurately managing certain conditions.

3. **Return Statements**: The return values in the `fixTeen` method consistently return `0`, indicating that the logic for handling 'teen' numbers has not been modified, despite the changes in variable handling in the `noTeenSum` method.

Overall, the edits show a tendency to modify variable assignments incorrectly while emphasizing the importance of precise condition checks to manage specific values effectively.

Cluster 15:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pairs involves a logical inversion of the condition used to determine the presence of a value in the array. In each case, the initial implementation checks for consecutive occurrences of the specified value (`val`), returning `true` if such pairs are found. The final implementation, however, checks for consecutive non-occurrences of `val`, returning `false` if such pairs are found. Additionally, the return values are inverted: the initial code returns `true` for a condition being met, whereas the final code returns `false` for the same condition, implying a fundamental change in the logic of the function. Overall, these edits reflect a shift from a search for the presence of a value to a search for its absence in adjacent elements.

Cluster 14:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pairs involves modifying the loop conditions to prevent out-of-bounds errors when accessing elements in the `nums` array. Specifically, the iterations have been adjusted from `i < nums.length` or `i <= nums.length - 1` to `i < nums.length - 1` or `i <= nums.length - 2`. This change ensures that the code safely checks adjacent elements without exceeding the array bounds. Additionally, there are comments added (though not functionally impactful) which appear to be remnants of previous logic considerations.

Cluster 12:
The code pairs exhibit common patterns of edits focused on simplifying the logic and improving code readability. Key changes include:

1. **Removal of Conditional Checks**: The initial code often included explicit checks for the range of values (e.g., checking if numbers are between 13 and 19) before calling the `fixTeen` method. The final code streamlines this by directly applying `fixTeen` to each argument without pre-checks, effectively reducing redundancy.

2. **Direct Return of Function Results**: Instead of modifying the input values conditionally within the `fixTeen` method, the final versions directly return the adjusted values, which enhances clarity and eliminates unnecessary variable reassignment.

3. **Consolidation of Logic**: The final `fixTeen` method combines the logic for returning the original number or zero into fewer conditional checks, making it more concise and easier to understand.

4. **Consistent Use of Variable Assignment**: In the final versions, values from `fixTeen` are assigned back to the original parameters (`a`, `b`, `c`) before summation, ensuring that the calculations reflect the fixed values.
