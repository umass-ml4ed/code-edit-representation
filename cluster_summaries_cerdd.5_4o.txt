Cluster 1:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pairs involves correcting logical errors in handling specific conditions. In the first code pair, the condition for checking if `c` is 13 was corrected from `if (c==0)` to `if (c==13)`. In the second code pair, there is an attempt to fix the logic for updating the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the `fixTeen` method, although the implementation is still incorrect as the method is not correctly modifying the input variables. Overall, the edits aim to address logical inaccuracies in conditional checks and variable handling.

Cluster 15:
The common edit pattern across all code pairs involves changing the logic from checking if there exists at least one consecutive pair of elements both equal to `val` (which returns true) to ensuring that no two consecutive elements are both not equal to `val` (which returns false). This effectively changes the condition to check if `val` appears in every pair of consecutive elements, altering the return values and conditions within the loop to invert the logic and final return statement.

Cluster 14:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs involves adjusting the loop condition to prevent out-of-bounds access by ensuring the loop iterates up to `nums.length - 1` or `nums.length - 2` instead of `nums.length`. This change ensures that the code does not attempt to access an index beyond the array's last valid element. Additionally, a commented-out condition checking for even-length arrays was introduced but left unused.

Cluster 12:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs involves modifying the `noTeenSum` function to directly use the `fixTeen` function on its parameters and store the result, thereby ensuring that the logic within `fixTeen` is applied correctly. Additionally, `fixTeen` is adjusted to return the input value for non-teen numbers directly, optimizing the code by eliminating unnecessary assignments. This change ensures that the sum calculation in `noTeenSum` accurately reflects the intended logic for handling teen values.

Cluster 0:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pairs involves adding an additional conditional check to handle the scenario when `isMorning` is true. Initially, the code returned false for all cases except when `isAsleep` was false and `isMorning` and `isMom` were true. The final code introduces a new condition to explicitly return false if `isMorning` is true, otherwise, it defaults to returning true.

Cluster 9:
The common edit pattern across all code pairs involves adding a condition to check whether the variable `a` or `b` is less than 21 before returning it. This ensures that only values that do not exceed 21 are considered valid outputs, aligning with the rules of the blackjack game.

Cluster 8:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs involves adjusting the condition checks for the variables `a` and `b` to include values equal to 21. Specifically, comparisons using `< 21` have been changed to `<= 21` to correctly handle cases where the value is exactly 21, ensuring that such values are considered valid in the context of the blackjack game logic.

Cluster 10:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pairs involves replacing a placeholder return statement with a complete logic implementation. This includes initializing variables to track sums (e.g., `left`, `right`, `front`, `tail`), iterating through the array to compute and compare these sums, and returning a boolean result based on whether a balance condition is met. Each final code introduces loops and conditional checks to achieve the desired functionality.

Cluster 3:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pairs involves correcting the initialization or updating logic of variables within loops and adding missing conditional branches. Specifically, in the `canBalance` function, the initialization of `y` within the loop was adjusted to ensure proper summation, while in the `redTicket` function, an additional condition was introduced to handle a specific case not covered in the initial version. These changes enhance the accuracy and completeness of the logic.

Cluster 23:
The primary edit pattern across the code pairs involves initializing boolean variables or conditions to a more logically appropriate default value to ensure correct behavior. Specifically, in the first two code pairs, the initial value of the `balanced` variable was changed from `false` to `true` to correctly handle cases where no 'x' is present without a subsequent 'y'. In the third code pair, an additional condition was added to handle cases where both 'x' and 'y' are absent (i.e., their last index is `-1`), ensuring the function returns `true` in such scenarios. These changes improve the logical correctness of the function.

Cluster 27:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs involves enhancing the logic to cover more general cases and handle edge cases more robustly. In the `evenlySpaced` function, an additional condition was added to check another possible spacing scenario. In the `getSandwich` function, the logic was modified from checking only the start and end to identifying the first and last occurrence of "bread," allowing for more flexible substring extraction.

Cluster 17:
The common edit pattern across all code pairs involves enhancing the condition for determining if the integers are evenly spaced. The initial code only checks one condition for spacing using the absolute difference between two pairs of numbers. The final code adds an additional condition by using the absolute difference between another pair of numbers to ensure all scenarios of evenly spaced integers are covered. This change ensures the method correctly identifies evenly spaced numbers in more cases.

Cluster 16:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs involves correcting logical conditions and simplifying control flow. Specifically, adjustments were made to the logical operators to ensure correct condition evaluation, such as changing `||` to `&&` or vice versa, and removing redundant or incorrect conditions. Additionally, unnecessary conditions or blocks were removed to streamline the code execution.

Cluster 2:
The common edit pattern across all provided code pairs involves modifying the logic that calculates the sum when two out of the three input values are equal. The initial code incorrectly adds one of the equal values to the third value, while the final code correctly updates the logic to only use the non-equal value in the sum.

Cluster 20:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs involves correcting conditions and comparisons within the `if` statements. In the first two code pairs, the condition checking array bounds and values was adjusted by changing `(i + 2) != nums.length` to `(i + 1) != nums.length` and comparing `nums[i]` instead of `nums[i+1]`. In the third code pair, an absolute value function was applied to the difference calculation within the condition to ensure accuracy, changing `(a-b) == (b-c)` to `Math.abs(a-b) == Math.abs(b-c)`. Overall, these edits improve the logic and correctness of the condition checks.

Cluster 4:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pairs involves fixing logical errors, particularly in conditions and index calculations. In the `zipZap` function, the final code ensures a character is appended correctly after the loop by moving the `newStr.concat("p")` outside of the loop. In the `caughtSpeeding` function, a logical error in the condition (`isBirthday = true`) is corrected, and a boundary condition is adjusted by changing `<` to `<=`. In the `getSandwich` function, an index calculation error is corrected by adjusting the substring length from `str.length() - 6` to `str.length() - 5`. These edits focus on correcting the logic to ensure the functions perform as intended.

Cluster 18:
The common edit patterns across the code pairs include correcting logical conditions and improving code readability. Specifically, the condition `if (isBirthday = true)` was corrected to `if (isBirthday == true)` or simply `if (isBirthday)` to properly check the boolean value. For the loop condition in the `zipZap` function, the loop's termination condition was adjusted to ensure all characters in the string are considered. Additionally, there was an update in the logic within the `caughtSpeeding` function regarding how the speed adjustment is applied when it is someone's birthday.

Cluster 11:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pairs involves correcting logical errors and improving the condition checks to achieve the desired functionality. Specifically, the edits focus on:

1. **Condition Verification:** The logic for verifying conditions has been refined. For example, checking if a string ends with "x" to handle edge cases, ensuring the correct substring is extracted based on indices, and accurately checking for the presence of values in arrays.

2. **Loop and Return Logic:** The loops have been adjusted to ensure they exit or return at the correct times, preventing premature termination or incorrect results. This includes using `break` or setting loop variables to terminate loops early when conditions are met.

3. **Variable Initialization and Usage:** Initialization and usage of variables have been corrected to properly capture and utilize relevant indices or states, such as using `lastIndexOf` and `indexOf` to identify boundaries for substring extraction.

Overall, these edits enhance the logical flow and correctness of the code, ensuring the functions perform their intended tasks accurately.

Cluster 28:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs involves correcting logical errors and refining conditions to ensure the desired functionality. In the first code pair, the logic for handling the `outsideMode` was adjusted to properly check the range conditions. In the second code pair, the loop increment was corrected to skip the correct number of indices when a specific pattern is found. In the third code pair, the logic was refined to handle cases where all inputs are equal and to correctly compute the sum for unique values, ensuring only non-duplicate numbers are added.

Cluster 29:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs involves correcting logical conditions within the return statements. In the first code pair, the condition for setting the `everywhere` boolean to true was adjusted from checking if `numTimes` was at least twice the length of the array (`nums.length * 2`) to half the length (`nums.length / 2`). In the second and third code pairs, the condition in the return statement was changed from comparing `(a - b == b - c)` to `(a - b == c - b)`, fixing the logical comparison for determining if the numbers are evenly spaced.

Cluster 22:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs involves replacing the immediate return statements based on conditions with the introduction of counters (`good` and `bad`) that track occurrences of these conditions. The final decision to return `true` or `false` is then based on the values of these counters, specifically whether the `bad` counter is greater than zero. This change shifts the decision-making from an immediate return approach to a more cumulative evaluation of conditions throughout the loops.

Cluster 25:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pairs involves adding an `else` clause to handle cases where the condition is not met, ensuring a boolean variable is explicitly set to `false` when necessary. This pattern improves the correctness and clarity of the code by explicitly defining behavior for all logical paths. Additionally, in the third code pair, the initial value of the boolean variable `neighbor` was changed from `false` to `true`, and conditions were adjusted to simplify the logic by using negations to directly set `neighbor` to `false` when the condition is unmet.

Cluster 13:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pairs involves correcting logical conditions to ensure accurate evaluation of the intended algorithm. In the first code pair, the logic was modified to correctly determine whether the condition holds for every adjacent pair by adjusting the initialization and assignment of the boolean variable. In the second code pair, boundary conditions were refined by adjusting the index handling within the loop to avoid out-of-bounds errors. In the third code pair, the final condition for checking evenly spaced numbers was corrected to properly reflect the mathematical relationship among the variables.

Cluster 26:
The common edit patterns across the code pairs include correcting logical errors and improving the flow of conditional checks. In the first code pair, the conditional logic for swapping elements to sort them was corrected to ensure the correct order of variables before performing the comparison for evenly spaced values. In both instances of the `isEverywhere` function, the logic was adjusted to correctly handle edge cases and ensure accurate evaluation of conditions, either by correcting the return value for single-element arrays or by adjusting the logic to properly assess the presence of the specified value in the array.

Cluster 5:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pair involves changing the logic for constructing the new string. Initially, the code used a `for` loop and `StringBuilder.deleteCharAt()` to modify the string in place by removing characters directly. In the final code, this approach was replaced with a `while` loop that constructs a new string entirely by appending characters to the `StringBuilder` based on conditions, thereby avoiding direct modification of the original string. Additionally, the final code introduces a new integer `len` to store the length of the string for better readability and efficiency.

Cluster 21:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs includes adding or modifying conditional checks to ensure the correctness of the logic. In the first code pair, a regex match condition was introduced to verify the presence of "bread" twice in the string before proceeding with further logic. In the second code pair, the `else` statement was removed to correct the logical flow, ensuring the conditions are checked independently for both `isBirthday` true and false cases. Both edits focus on improving the accuracy of the program's conditional logic.

Cluster 19:
The edits across the code pairs involve changing the logic from using a `while` loop with manual index management and string appending to a `for` loop with direct string manipulation. Specifically, the final code utilizes `StringBuilder.deleteCharAt()` to remove a character between 'z' and 'p' directly, streamlining the process by eliminating unnecessary appending and simplifying the loop logic.

Cluster 6:
The common edit pattern across all the provided code pairs involves correcting the comparison logic within nested loops. Initially, the code compares characters directly to indices of characters, which is logically incorrect. The final code correctly uses `str.indexOf(x)` and `str.indexOf(y)` in comparisons instead of comparing characters to indices, ensuring proper logical evaluation of character positions within the string.

Cluster 7:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs involves refining the logic for conditions and loops. In the first code pair, the condition `a < 21` was changed to `a <= 21` to correctly handle edge cases when `a` is exactly 21. In the second and third code pairs, the condition checking the presence of "bread" twice in the string was either modified or removed to improve performance and correctness. Additionally, in the second code pair, the loop for finding the second occurrence of "bread" was adjusted to search backward from the end, enhancing the logic to correctly identify the substring between the first and last "bread".

Cluster 24:
The common edit patterns across the code pairs involve fixing logical conditions and simplifying control flow for correctness. In the first code pair, the logic was corrected by adjusting the condition that determines which number is closer to 21, ensuring both values are compared correctly and redundant conditions are removed. In the second code pair, the logic was streamlined by removing unnecessary checks and simplifying the loop condition to correctly determine if the specified value appears everywhere. Both edits focus on improving the logical correctness and efficiency of the code.
