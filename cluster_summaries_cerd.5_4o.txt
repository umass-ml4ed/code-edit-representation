Cluster 16:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pairs involves correcting the conditional logic to ensure the proper handling of specific cases. In the `luckySum` function, the condition for checking the value `c` was corrected from `c==0` to `c==13`. In the `noTeenSum` function, the logic for returning the sum when encountering a specific range of values (13 to 19) was refined to correctly account for these cases by changing the return statements to ensure the correct summation of the remaining values. Additionally, the final code introduces nested conditions to handle scenarios where multiple values fall within the specified range, returning 0 when all values meet the criteria. The `fixTeen` function remains unchanged in all instances.

Cluster 20:
The common edit pattern across all provided code pairs involves changing the logic of a loop that checks for a condition. Initially, the code checks if any consecutive elements in the array are equal to the specified value and returns true if this condition is met, defaulting to false otherwise. In the final code, this logic is reversed to check if any consecutive elements are both not equal to the specified value, returning false if this is the case, and defaulting to true if no such pair is found. This change alters the function's purpose from finding pairs of the specified value to ensuring that at least one of every pair is the specified value.

Cluster 7:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs is the adjustment of the loop condition to prevent out-of-bounds access. The final code in each case modifies the loop's termination condition to `i < nums.length - 1` or `i <= nums.length - 2`, ensuring that the access to `nums[i+1]` does not exceed the array bounds. Additionally, comments were added in some versions to indicate possible considerations such as checking conditions for even-length arrays, although this was commented out and not applied.

Cluster 15:
The common edit pattern across all code pairs involves changing the assignment of variable `n` to the parameters `a`, `b`, and `c` before calling the `fixTeen` method. The final code assigns `n` directly to `a`, `b`, and `c` before invoking `fixTeen`. However, this does not achieve the intended logic of modifying `a`, `b`, and `c` values based on the `fixTeen` logic, as the `fixTeen` method does not return the modified value of `n` or modify the original parameters. The change introduces a logical error as it mistakenly assigns `n` to `a`, `b`, and `c`, effectively setting them to zero instead of utilizing the `fixTeen` logic to filter out specific teen values.

Cluster 14:
The common edits across all code pairs involve modifying the `fixTeen` method to properly handle the values of `n`. The condition within `fixTeen` was updated to exclude the values 15 and 16 from being set to 0, using the condition `(n != 15 || n != 16)`. Additionally, the method now returns the potentially modified value of `n` instead of a constant 0. In the `noTeenSum` method, the assignment of `n` was corrected to use `n = a`, `n = b`, and `n = c` instead of setting `a`, `b`, and `c` to `n`, ensuring that the original values are correctly passed to `fixTeen`.

Cluster 29:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs involves correcting logical conditions within the if-else statements to ensure the functions return the intended results. This includes adjusting condition checks to properly evaluate special cases and ensuring all scenarios are accounted for in the logic, as demonstrated by modifying the conditions in `fixTeen` and adding an additional condition in `answerCell` to handle when it is morning but not the user's mom calling.

Cluster 2:
The common edit pattern across all code pairs involves correcting the logic for handling cases where one of the inputs exceeds 21 in the blackjack game. The initial code incorrectly returns the value of `a` when `a` is greater than 21, whereas the correct behavior, as shown in the final code, is to return the value of `b` when `a` is greater than 21 and vice versa. Additionally, an extra condition is added to handle the case where `b` is greater than 21, returning `a`. This ensures that the function correctly identifies the closest valid number to 21 when one or both numbers exceed 21.

Cluster 4:
The edits across the code pairs primarily involve adjustments to conditional logic, specifically refining the bounds of comparisons. The changes ensure that the values are strictly less than a certain threshold, improving the accuracy of the conditions being checked.

Cluster 12:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs involves correcting the conditional check for values less than 21 to less than or equal to 21. This change ensures that the code properly considers values equal to 21 as valid, aligning with the rules of the blackjack game where 21 is the maximum desired value.

Cluster 8:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pairs involves refining the logic to accurately implement the intended functionality. This includes initializing variables to track sums or ranges, iterating through loops with correct conditions, and adjusting logical operators to ensure correct comparisons and outcomes. Specifically, the changes often involve adding loops to accumulate sums, adjusting comparison operators (e.g., changing `||` to `&&`), and implementing logic to compare accumulated values or validate conditions more precisely. Overall, these edits transition the code from a placeholder or incorrect logic to a working solution that correctly fulfills its intended purpose.

Cluster 0:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pairs involves expanding the conditional logic to handle additional cases that the initial code did not account for. In the `redTicket` function, an extra condition was added to return a specific result when certain values are not equal. Similarly, in both instances of the `evenlySpaced` function, additional conditions were added to cover more permutations of input values that can satisfy the evenly spaced criteria. Overall, these edits enhance the functionality by accounting for more scenarios.

Cluster 27:
The common edit patterns across the provided code pairs include optimizing the logic for detecting and handling the sequence "zp" in strings. The initial implementations either incorrectly handled string concatenation or had redundant checks and variables. Edits focused on improving efficiency by using `StringBuilder` for better performance, streamlining conditions to correctly identify and handle the pattern, and ensuring the sequence is managed correctly across different scenarios. Additionally, some unnecessary code segments and conditions were removed to simplify and correct the logic.

Cluster 3:
The edits across the code pairs primarily involve correcting logical conditions within `if` statements. In the first code pair, the condition for setting the `checker` variable was adjusted within the `else` block. In the second and third code pairs, an additional condition was introduced to handle the scenario where all three variables are equal, returning 0 in such cases. These edits improve the accuracy of the logical flow and ensure that all edge cases are correctly handled.

Cluster 5:
The common edit pattern across all code pairs involves changing the sums calculated in the conditional statements. Specifically, when two of the three integers are equal, the sum is revised to include only the third distinct integer rather than the previous sum that included duplicates.

Cluster 6:
The common edit pattern across all code pairs involves changing the logic to find the first and last occurrence of the substring "bread" using `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf` methods, instead of relying on `startsWith` and `endsWith`. The substring extraction logic is updated to use these indices to correctly handle cases where "bread" occurs more than once in the string.

Cluster 1:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs involves fixing logical errors related to indexing and variable usage. In the first and third code pairs, the logic for identifying and processing substrings between specific markers ("bread") was corrected by adjusting index calculations to account for the length of the marker. In the second code pair, new variables were introduced to correctly handle calculations and comparisons, ensuring the logic operates on adjusted values rather than altering the original inputs.

Cluster 11:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs involves adding or modifying conditions to ensure the correct execution of the code. Specifically, unnecessary initial checks that could prematurely exit the function were removed in the first code pair, while additional checks were added in the third code pair to validate input conditions before proceeding with the main logic. Additionally, there were adjustments to loop conditions to ensure proper iteration over the string in the second code pair.

Cluster 17:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs involves correcting logical errors in the conditions and loops. In the `zipZap` function, the loop condition was modified to iterate through the correct range of the string. In the `isEverywhere` function, the condition to determine if a value is "everywhere" was corrected from multiplying to dividing by 2. In the `evenlySpaced` function, redundant or incorrect condition checks were removed to streamline the logic. Overall, the edits focused on correcting logical and boundary conditions to ensure the functions operate as intended.

Cluster 10:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pairs involves replacing the direct return statements with counters to track conditions. Specifically, the final code introduces `good` and `bad` counters to accumulate instances where conditions are met rather than immediately returning `true` or `false`. The final decision on the return value is made based on the values of these counters, ensuring that the entire string is evaluated before determining the outcome.

Cluster 24:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs involves adding additional conditional checks to handle new scenarios or edge cases. In the `redTicket` function, an extra condition was added to return 5 when all three parameters are equal, enhancing the original logic. In the `isEverywhere` function, the loop was modified to prevent out-of-bounds access by ensuring the index does not exceed the array length, thus improving robustness.

Cluster 9:
The common edit pattern across all code pairs involves changing the conditional check from using the less-than operator (`<`) to using the less-than-or-equal-to operator (`<=`) for determining the `ticketSize` in both the birthday and non-birthday cases.

Cluster 22:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pairs involves correcting the conditional check from an assignment (`=`) to a comparison (`==`) for the `isBirthday` boolean variable. Additionally, in one instance, the shorthand `if(isBirthday)` is used as a more concise way to check the boolean value. These changes ensure that the condition is evaluated correctly rather than inadvertently assigning a value.

Cluster 28:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs involves updating the logic to accurately identify and extract the substring between two occurrences of the word "bread". The initial implementations incorrectly checked for "bread" using methods like `startsWith` and `endsWith` or incomplete substring comparisons. The final versions use `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf` to locate the positions of the first and last occurrences of "bread", ensuring the substring extraction is performed correctly between these indices. Additionally, conditions are improved to handle cases where "bread" is not found or appears only once.

Cluster 26:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs involves changing the approach from using a `while` loop with manual index manipulation and string appending to a `for` loop that directly modifies the `StringBuilder` by deleting characters. This change simplifies the logic by removing the need to manually append characters and adjust the index, focusing instead on directly removing the middle character in the "z_p" pattern within the loop.

Cluster 25:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pairs includes adding early termination to loops using `break` or setting loop counters to their termination values to prevent unnecessary iterations. This optimizes the code by improving efficiency and performance, ensuring that once a condition is met or a certain task is completed, the loop exits immediately rather than continuing through all iterations.

Cluster 13:
The common edit pattern across the code pairs involves correcting the condition checks for speed limits. The changes include adjusting the comparison operators to ensure accurate evaluation of speed against the limits, changing `<=` to `<` for the lower boundary check, and `>` to `>=` for the upper boundary check in the `else if` conditions. Additionally, the assignment operator `=` in the condition `if (isBirthday = true)` should be corrected to the equality operator `==` to properly compare the boolean value of `isBirthday`. However, this specific correction is not reflected in the final code provided.

Cluster 23:
The edits simplify the code by replacing manual loops and substring comparisons with string index methods (`indexOf` and `lastIndexOf`) to find the positions of "bread" more efficiently. This reduces complexity and improves readability.

Cluster 18:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pairs involves refining conditional logic to handle specific edge cases more accurately. In the `canBalance` function, the condition `front <= tail` was changed to `front < tail` to ensure a more precise balance check. In `caughtSpeeding`, the logic was reorganized to account for the birthday scenario more clearly and to handle speed ranges more explicitly. In `blackjack`, additional conditions were added to handle cases where one or both inputs exceed 21, ensuring correct returns based on game rules. These changes collectively improve correctness and edge case handling in the logic.

Cluster 19:
The common edit pattern observed across the code pair involves the enhancement of the initial code from returning a fixed string to implementing conditional logic that handles multiple specific input cases, returning different strings for each case.

Cluster 21:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pairs involves commenting out the entire `while` loop section that iterates through the string to find the substring "bread". The commented out section includes the loop condition and the increment statement within the loop, indicating a removal or deactivation of this logic in the final code version.
