Cluster 0:
The provided code pairs exhibit a variety of edits, primarily involving changes to the return values and conditions in functions. In the first two pairs, the return value for the case where `a` or `c` equals 13 has been modified to return 0 instead of the value of `c` or the sum of `a + b`. The third pair alters the temperature range for summer from 90 to 100 degrees. The fourth pair refines the temperature checks for non-summer conditions, changing the upper limit from 100 to 90 degrees. Lastly, the final pair introduces an additional return condition for the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all different, returning 1. Overall, these edits adjust both logic and output in various functions, ensuring specific cases are handled differently.

Cluster 1:
The provided code pairs include modifications to two methods: `luckySum` and `redTicket`. In the `luckySum` method, an additional condition was added to return the value of `a` if `b` is equal to 13, while the original version only returned 0 in such cases. In the `redTicket` method, a new condition was introduced to return 1 when `a`, `b`, and `c` are all different, which was not covered in the original implementation that only accounted for specific matching cases. Overall, both methods were enhanced to handle more scenarios and return additional values.

Cluster 2:
The code was modified by adding a condition to check if the variable `c` equals 13. If `c` is 13, the function now returns the sum of `a` and `b`, while if none of the variables (`a`, `b`, or `c`) are 13, it returns the sum of all three variables (`a`, `b`, and `c`).

Cluster 3:
The provided code pairs exhibit the following edits: 

1. In the first code pair, the condition checks for `b` and `c` being equal to 13 were changed from independent `if` statements to `else if` statements, ensuring only one condition can trigger a different sum calculation based on the order of checks.

2. In the second code pair, an additional check for `a` being equal to 13 was introduced at the start of the conditions, allowing for a more comprehensive handling of the input values.

3. The subsequent code pairs for the `redTicket` function showed no changes between the original and modified versions, indicating no edits were made in those instances.

Overall, the key modifications involved restructuring conditional statements to improve logical flow and handling of specific cases in the `luckySum` function, while the `redTicket` function remained unchanged across all pairs.

Cluster 4:
The code has been modified to handle additional cases where the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` may be equal to 13. In the revised version, if any of the three parameters (`a`, `b`, or `c`) equals 13, it sets that parameter and the subsequent ones to 0, ensuring that all occurrences of 13 are accounted for before returning the sum of the three parameters.

Cluster 5:
In the provided code pairs, the edits involve adding an additional conditional check to the `redTicket` method. Specifically, an `else if` clause is introduced to handle the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all different, returning a value of `1`. This modification enhances the function's logic by allowing it to account for a previously unaddressed scenario, while maintaining the original conditions and return values for the cases where `a` equals `b` and `c`.

Cluster 6:
The edits across the provided code pairs include changes to the conditions for returning values in the `redTicket` method. Specifically, the first code snippet checks for the condition where `b` is equal to `a` or `c` to return `0`, while the second snippet replaces this with a condition that checks whether both `b` and `c` are not equal to `a` to return `1`. Additionally, the condition for returning `10` was modified from checking if `b` and `c` are equal to `2` to checking if all three variables are equal to `2`. Overall, the logic for determining return values has been restructured for clarity and correctness.

Cluster 7:
The code edit adds a new conditional statement to the `redTicket` method that checks if all three parameters (`a`, `b`, and `c`) are equal (i.e., `a == b && a == c && b == c`). If this condition is met, the method now returns a value of 5, in addition to the existing condition that returns 10 when all parameters are equal to 2.

Cluster 8:
In the provided code edits, the main change involves modifying the last conditional check in the `redTicket` method. The original code returned `0` when two of the parameters were equal, while the edited version now returns `1` if either `a` is equal to `b` or `b` is equal to `c`, thereby altering the behavior of the function when two parameters match.

Cluster 9:
The edits introduce additional conditions to the `redTicket` method, specifically checking if `b` and `c` are not equal to `a` to return 1, and if either `b` or `c` equals `a` to return 0. The original logic for returning 5 when all three values are equal and not equal to 2, as well as returning 10 otherwise, remains unchanged but is now part of a broader condition structure.

Cluster 10:
The edits made include changing the return value in the second condition from `return 0;` to `return a;` when the variable `b` is equal to 13, altering the logic of the function to return the value of `a` instead of zero under that condition.

Cluster 11:
The edits made to the `luckySum` method involve simplifying the conditional checks for the variable `b` and introducing a new check for the variable `c`. The original code returned a sum based on whether `a` or `b` was 13, while the updated code checks if `b` is 13 first, and if not, it then checks if `c` is 13, allowing for a more straightforward computation of the sum based on which variables are set to 13.

Cluster 12:
The code was modified to include an additional condition that allows for returning true when it is summer and the temperature is between 90 and 100 degrees, enhancing the logic to accommodate summer temperature scenarios.

Cluster 13:
The edits involve changing the condition for returning 1 points in the `redTicket` method from checking if the last two parameters `b` and `c` are equal (`b==c`) to checking that both `b` and `c` are not equal to `a` (`b!=a && c!=a`), altering the logic of the scoring system.

Cluster 14:
The code was modified to change the condition for returning 1 in the `redTicket` method. The original condition checked if `b` was equal to `c`, while the updated condition checks if either `b` is equal to `c` or both `b` is not equal to `c` and `a` is not equal to `b`.
