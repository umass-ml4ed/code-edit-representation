Cluster 16:
The edits across the provided code pairs exhibit several common patterns aimed at refining the logic and handling of specific values:

1. **Conditional Adjustments**: In both the `luckySum` and `noTeenSum` methods, there were modifications to the conditions checking for particular values (e.g., `13` and `19`). The checks were refined to ensure that the logic correctly sums or ignores values based on the presence of `13`.

2. **Return Value Changes**: The return statements were altered to provide more accurate results based on the input conditions. For instance, in `luckySum`, handling of the case when `c` equals `13` was added, while in `noTeenSum`, the return values were adjusted to sum the appropriate remaining values when one of the parameters is `13`.

3. **Code Structure Improvements**: The final versions introduced more structured and nested conditional statements in `noTeenSum`, which serves to clarify the logic flow and ensure that all cases are explicitly handled. This change improves readability and maintainability.

4. **Consistency in Logic**: Both methods show a trend toward consistent handling of edge cases, ensuring that when specific values are encountered, the function behaves predictably.

These patterns indicate a focus on enhancing logic clarity, ensuring accurate conditional checks, and improving code structure for better readability and functionality.

Cluster 20:
The edits across the provided code pairs exhibit a consistent pattern of modifying the logic within the loop that iterates through the array. In each case, the original condition checks if two consecutive elements are equal to a specified value (`val`). This is changed to check if both elements are not equal to `val`, thereby transforming the function's intent from identifying the presence of consecutive occurrences of `val` to confirming that `val` is present at least once in alternating positions. Additionally, all instances maintain the loop structure and return statements but invert the boolean logic to reflect the new condition being evaluated.

Cluster 7:
The common edit patterns across the provided code pairs include:

1. **Loop Boundary Adjustments**: In all cases, the loop's termination condition was modified to prevent accessing out-of-bounds elements. The original code iterated to `nums.length` or `nums.length - 1`, while the final versions consistently adjusted the loop to iterate only up to `nums.length - 2`.

2. **Commented Out Code**: A line of code checking for even-length arrays was commented out in the final versions, indicating a decision to ignore that logic while retaining it for potential future use.

3. **Consistent Logic Structure**: Despite the changes, the overall logic structure of the method remains intact, focusing on checking adjacent elements for a specified value. 

These edits enhance the code's safety by preventing potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` while maintaining the intended functionality.

Cluster 15:
The edits across the provided code pairs exhibit a common pattern of variable handling in the `noTeenSum` method. Specifically, the variable `n` is consistently initialized and assigned to `a`, `b`, and `c` in each code pair, leading to incorrect results. Instead of using `n` to modify the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, the final code incorrectly assigns `n` (which remains 0) back to `a`, `b`, and `c` before invoking the `fixTeen` method. The `fixTeen` method itself remains unchanged in both initial and final versions. Overall, the primary edit pattern involves incorrect variable assignment and a failure to effectively utilize the `fixTeen` method to correctly process the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Cluster 14:
The provided code pairs exhibit several common edit patterns aimed at correcting functionality and enhancing clarity. The main changes include:

1. **Variable Assignment Correction**: The initial code incorrectly assigns the same variable `n` to the inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` rather than checking their values. The final code correctly assigns `n` to `a`, `b`, and `c` one at a time, ensuring that each input is processed individually.

2. **Improved Conditional Logic**: The condition in the `fixTeen` method is refined to exclude the specific values 15 and 16 from being set to 0 when they are passed. The final code uses a compound condition that correctly represents this logic by checking if `n` is both in the range 13-19 and not equal to 15 or 16.

3. **Return Value Adjustment**: The return value of `fixTeen` is corrected from always returning 0 to returning the modified value of `n`, allowing the function to perform its intended task of adjusting the value based on the input.

These edits enhance the code's functionality, ensuring that it properly calculates the sum without "teen" values as specified.

Specifically, in the `in1To10` method, the modification involved clarifying the checks for the valid range of `n` based on the `outsideMode` flag, ultimately correcting the logic to avoid false positives. For the `loneSum` method, both pairs improved the handling of identical inputs by introducing a comprehensive check for all three parameters being equal, resulting in a clearer and more efficient return of zero when necessary. These changes reflect a trend towards reducing complexity and ensuring accurate control flow.

Cluster 5:
The edits across the provided code pairs primarily involve changing the assignment of the variable `sum` in the conditional statements. In each case, the initial code assigns the sum of two variables when two of the three input integers are equal (e.g., `sum = a + c`, `sum = a + b`). The final code modifies these assignments to simply assign the third variable when two inputs are identical (e.g., `sum = c`, `sum = b`). This consistent pattern reflects a shift in logic to return only the non-duplicate value when two inputs match, while keeping the logic for the case where all three inputs are distinct the same (i.e., `sum = a + b + c`). Overall, the edits streamline the handling of duplicate values.

Cluster 6:
The common edit pattern across the provided code pairs involves replacing the initial checks for the presence of the substring "bread" at both the start and end of the input string with a more flexible approach. Specifically, the edits introduce the use of `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf` to find the first and last occurrence of "bread." This allows for the extraction of the substring between the two occurrences of "bread," accommodating cases where there might be multiple "bread" substrings, rather than strictly requiring "bread" to be at the start and end. The overall structure remains intact, but the logic becomes more robust and versatile.

Cluster 1:
